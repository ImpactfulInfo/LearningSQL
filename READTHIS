These are various coding files from MSSQL and MySQL capturing the skills I've been learning throughout the past couple of months showcasing what skill I was trying to learn and how to properly use them in a query.

You may use this as a way of seeing how to format and write certain queries. Or critique my code and show me how to better perform the queries I'm looking for. 
(MOST ARE FROM THE FIRST MONTH OF ME USING THE LANGUAGE SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CRITIQUE AND GIVE NOTES ON WHAT CAN IMPROVE)


P.S. I now  CAPS all of my queries I was still learning and did not know the importance of capitalizing the commands
